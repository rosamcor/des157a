            <h1>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h1>
            <time datetime="2023-02-13">February 13th, 2023</time>

            <p>One helpful item <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Baskanderi's article</a> provided was more insight of what parts to include when creating an overlay. These items include a descriptive title, size & location, escape hatch, a shadow (focus), a button label, and an action that leads to the pop-up activation. This is a helpful tool for someone who is shifting roles from a user to a designer because as the author mentioned, many users now find overlays annoying. Thus, as a user myself, I do not often pay attention to the designs of overlays as I fight to get them off my screen. I enjoyed how the author also directed some time to explain why modals do not work well in mobile. Overall, the article did a great job in helping me shift my views from a user to a designer and prepare myself for making overlays.</p>

            <h1>Best Practices for Form Design</h1>
            <time datetime="2023-02-09">February 9th, 2023</time>

            <p>As I read<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Ansari's article</a>, I recalled how much I can love or hate filling out forms. Thus, I loved seeing the amount of thought the author put into the details of form design. One of my favorite parts of form design is the process of breaking up the amount of information displayed. I agree with the author who says it is best to break up the number of fields into steps and not display it all on one page. Additionally, as the author recommends, I think having a visual that tracks the progress until the completion of the form is excellent. I think this also allows the user to predict if they will have enough time to fill out the form or if they will have to do it at a later time.</p>
            
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join">LinkedIn form</a> for creating a profile exemplifies a few good practices. To begin, they only ask for the necessary fields like email and password to join. Additionally, they explain the formatting requirements format the password and provide a show password option. After, providing this info you can click join and go to a field that asks for your first and last name before continuing. Thus, they are breaking down the information they ask for per page to minimize the cognitive load on the user. I think this is another demonstration of best practices.
