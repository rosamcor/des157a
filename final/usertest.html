            <h2>Observations</h2>
    
            <h4>Video</h4>
            <p>I realized that a highlight for many users was seeing the video and hearing its audio. It was the one that all testers actually spent more time seeing compared to picture and text-only overlays.</p>
    
            <h4>Color</h4>
            <p>The color, moreso the blue, seemed to be well received. It was definitely preferable to users when showing this and the previous colour palette of orange and brown. However, one user did say the current palette did not seem the most "pleasant". </p>
    
            <h4>Too Simple</h4>
            <p>The current home screen was often described as "bare", and not the best at catching attention.</p>
    
            <h2>Plans</h2>
            <p>My current plan is to definitely finish my goal of adding sound effects to the home page and see if that aids in catching the attention of users and making it less "bare".</p>
